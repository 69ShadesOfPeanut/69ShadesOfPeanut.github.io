	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>
        Minecraft modpacks were some of the first projects I started to work on and what really set out my passion for working on projects that others can engage with.<br>
        <br>
        This page will document the couple of my favourite / best done modpacks
	</p>
	
	<h2>Better Beta</h2>
	<p>
        In "Better Beta," you will relive the enchantment of Minecraft's early beta stages. Immerse yourself in the simplicity and charm of this bygone era as the modpack faithfully replicates the terrain generation, block textures, and gameplay mechanics of version 1.7.3. Rediscover the sense of wonder and adventure that captivated players in Minecraft's golden age.<br>
        <br>
        But that's not all - this modpack offers new elements to elevate your adventure. Experience the beauty of changing seasons as the world around you transforms, bringing forth unique challenges and breathtaking vistas. Witness the transition from lush spring landscapes to the frozen wonders of winter, each season imbued with its own enchanting atmosphere. Along with other changes such as the soundtrack being limited to C418 music.<br>
        <br>
        But beware, some things are best left forgotten in the shadows... Will you be the one to delve into the darkness and experience what it has to offer?
