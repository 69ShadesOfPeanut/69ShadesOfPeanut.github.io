		with it's native language, "GDScript"
	</p>
	
	<h2>Spectral Astro</h2>
	<p>
		Spectral Astro was a game made for the second game jam I participated in, the game jam being <a href="https://itch.io/jam/the-enigma-game-jam" target="_blank">the enigma game jam</a><br>
		The game is 2D and based off the gameplay and art style of Asteroids.

	<p>
		Ohio Invasion was my second and latest project, being made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-53" target="_blank">godot wildjam</a><br>
		Making the game for a game jam helped me with time management and working in a team as I coded alongside a friend.<br>
		The gamejam ran for just over a week and everyone had to follow a theme which was "Assembly required"
