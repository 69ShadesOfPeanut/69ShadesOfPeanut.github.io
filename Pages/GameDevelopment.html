	<h2>Forest Wanderer</h2>
	<p>
		Made for the 2023 kenney jam, the game jam took place over roughly 2 days<br>
		<br>
		Take on the role of someone who's entire job is to go searching into the dark woods at night in search of missing / lost items. <br>
		Learn not just to explore the forest but to respect it and its boundaries. And remember, the harder you push the harder that something is going to push back...
