	<h2>Astrophobia</h2>
	<p>
		Astrophobia is my first proper game development project. <br>
		set in a world that's plunging into choas, the player has their hands on a program made by SCI in order to recruit and trainpeople to go on a space colonisation mission <br>
		<br>
		The game is being developed inside of a engine called "Godot", a free open source game engine that uses GDScript as its main language.
